        <h2>The Beginning of Duck Dynasty</h2>
        <p>While the Robertson family are very succesful today that was not always the case. Phil and Kay were
            highschool sweethearts and got married young with Kay never finishing high school. Phil was signed for a
            football scholarship through Lousiana Tech University where he eared his Master's in Education. After
            teaching for several years Phil eventually decided that his time was better spent in the woods. Through this
            time Phil became a drunk and caused a lot of issues within his family. Phil however persevered and turned
            his life over to the Lord and made changes for the better in the mid 70's. By this point Kay and their four
            boys had helped Phil take his small duck call business idea come true. Going from a tiny shop at home the
            Robertson's have now built a multi-million dollar enterprise. The Robertson's have recently released a movie
            sharing their hardships named, "The Blind". Phil, Jase, and Al the three eldest boys have also released a
            podcast named "Unashamed" that you can find on your preffered podcast network. </p>

        <h3>The Robertson family</h3>
        <p>The Robertson family is very extensive. To attempt to name the entire family would be a very long
            everchanging list. The best part of watching the show from beginning to end is being able to watch the
            family grow in every way. Below the Robertson Men are pictured. From left to right, Phil Roberston the
            father, Jep Robertson the youngest, Uncle Si Roberston Phil's brother, Jase Robertson the 2nd born, and
            Willie Robertson the 3rd born. The next image is a larger photo of the family, still with a few missing.
